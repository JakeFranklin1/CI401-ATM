I have provided three different Jar files, ATM_MacOS is to be ran on Macs, otherwise feel free to choose one of the two Windows Jar files. I'd recommend the Java11 version for most compatibility, but if that for whatever reason fails and you have a Java version above 11, please try the other.

I'd recommend running the program through the terminal, do this with: java -jar ATM_Windows_Java11.jar

These Jar files should NOT fail as I've tested them extensively on my two systems and on the university computers, but if all of these fail then please follow the guide in the technical documentation (included in the "Report" folder) for setting it up in IntelliJ.
